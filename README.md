This program aims to automate the process of renaming, classifying, copying and taking care of downloaded torrents, specially movies.	



** Main functions:**

It delivers downloaded torrents by scanning its contents. I mean: stores downloaded files due to its nature and contents at pre-configured folder/s. (video, audio, others)  
It cleans filenames (very useful if you are used to download and rename files)  
It can automatically remove non wanted files (pe. .txt, .url)  
It can send e-mails to notify some done processes (pe. when a torrent have been downloaded)  
It scans a hot folder for new incoming .torrents, or covers, so you can add .torrents on the go and from mobile devices (v√≠a Dropbox pe.)  
It starts transmission service if new .torrents are detected into a specified folder.  
It avoids file copying processes while playing movies.  
It deletes delivered torrents due to a retention period of time.


**Integration with freevo 1.9x**  

It can find and select the most suitable cover from a repository folder and match to its videofile, so Freevo can read it as its cover.  
It can detect chapter-numbers at the end of the file/s, and rename them as nxnn so Freevo can group videofiles as chapters.  


** 3rd party software: **
This programs needs to run the following programs in your system:  

 * Transmission, with rpc API for python3
 * Dropbox (optional)

 ** Notes: **  

Remember to set up _TRWorkflowconfig.py_ first with your paths and preferences.  
Python3 is required to run the code.  
Tested on Ubuntu, it may not work properly in windows  
For the moment there is not a guide to setup this program, so ask me if you want to download and run it.  

Obviously this software comes without any guaranty, so use by your own risk.
