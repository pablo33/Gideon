# Gideon
-------------

This program aims to automate the process of renaming, classifying, copying and taking care of downloaded torrents, specially movies.	



** Main functions:**

It delivers downloaded torrents by scanning its contents. I mean: stores downloaded files due to its nature and contents at pre-configured folder/s. (video, audio, others)  
It cleans filenames (very useful if you are used to download and manually rename files)  
It can automatically remove non wanted files (pe. .txt, .url)  
It can send e-mails to notify some done processes (pe. when a torrent have been downloaded)  
It scans a hot folder for new incoming .torrents, or covers, so you can add .torrents on the go and from mobile devices (v√≠a Dropbox pe.)  
It starts transmission service if new .torrents are detected into a specified folder.  
It starts transmission service if there are pending downloads.  
It scans a hot-folder for files and process them.  
It avoids file copying processes while playing movies.  
It deletes delivered torrents due to a retention period of time.


It can find and select the most suitable cover from a repository folder and match to its videofile, so Freevo can read it as its cover.  
It can detect chapter-numbers at the end of the file/s, and rename them as nxnn so Freevo can group videofiles as chapters.  


** 3rd party software: **
This programs needs to run the following programs in your system:
